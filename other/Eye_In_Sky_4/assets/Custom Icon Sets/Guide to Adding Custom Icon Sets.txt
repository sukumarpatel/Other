GUIDE TO ADDING A CUSTOM ICON SET TO EYE IN SKY

This guide covers how to add a custom icon set to Eye In Sky.

An example icon set is already packaged with the application. The example icon set is called Sticky, and can be found under:

/mnt/sdcard/Android/data/com.citc.weather/Custom Icon Sets/Sticky

You will need to create another folder under Custom Icon Sets which will contain your own icon set.
The name of the folder will be used in the application as the name of your icon set.
Inside the Sticky folder you can see it contains all the icons as well as a map.txt.
The file map.txt is what maps the icons to the weather codes.
It also provides the name of the author of the icon set and an attribution url.
You will need to populate map.txt with your own mappings between the filenames of your icons and the weather codes of the application.
All entries in map.txt in the Sticky example icon set will also be required in your icon set.
Every weather code has both a day and a night version, although it is up to you whether you use different icons or the same ones for day and night weather.
For example in Sticky there is an icon 39.png which is used for the weather code CHANCE_OF_RAIN_D.
In your icon set the image might be called light_rain.png in which case your map.txt should contain:

CHANCE_OF_RAIN_D=light_rain.png

Also you should add a .nomedia to your custom icon set so that the icons donâ€™t start appearing in your photo gallery.
